# Intro App - Built with Meteor

Intro is a social application that makes networking introductions easier by allowing users the ability to check in to their current location and let other users meet up with them. It is an attempt at taking social networking off of the digital realm by acting like an easy and non-confrontational alternative to making a formal introduction.
